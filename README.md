# SQL

This project was completed as part of the Python I course taken from the University of Toronto- School of continuing Studies.

In this assignment, I used the customer.db to explore different aspects of SQL. The purpose of the assignment is to test abiity to write SQL queries to extract data from a relational database.

Here, it is assumed that I work at a large department store and have been asked to several datasets and conduct basic analysis to better understand customer's shopping patterns and profiles.

I worrked with the CustomersDatabase.db file which consists of 3 tables:
  1. Customers- This table provides demographic information about the customers
  2. Transactions- This table outlines all customers' transactions for the past 2 years
  3. Status- This table provides a status history for each customer, including dates they may have been upgraded. There are 3 loyalty tiers:          bronze, silver and gold

All you need to do is to load the CustomersDatabase.db. It is worthy of note that SQLite was used for this project
